        <h1>Van Building</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Over the past couple years, I've built two camper van conversions: one Mercedes Sprinter and one Ford Transit. Along the way, I've done a great deal of research and learned a lot. I decided to contribute that knowledge back to the van building community by creating this page.</p>
    <p>Initially, this page was going to be a complete build log of my first van &mdash; a 2004 Mercedes Sprinter. I completed several posts, but slowed down as life got busy.</p>
    <p>After about a year and a half of traveling and part time living in that van, I decided to sell it and build something a little more modern. Thus, in September of 2016, it sold and I immediately purchaced a 2015 Ford Transit.</p>
    <p>The next two months were spent completing the second build and juggling my day job. As time has allowed, I've been thinking about a plan for this site.</p>
    <p><b>Alas, the new plan!</b> I will try to finish documenting the first build with the photos and notes I took. However, I don't plan to do a complete build log of the second build. I figure, by now, the internet is full of build logs of all degrees.</p>
    <p>Instead, I would like to write a little more specifically about the components I chose, why I chose them and how they've performed. I think this will be a valuable contribution to the community as I found component selection to be one of the more time consuming processes. I may also discuss various building techniques I found to work well. And finally, I would like to put together mini shopping lists for people to use for various parts of the build (eg. X sink, Y faucet, Z fittings).</p>
    <p>I think, together, this would be a huge help to some people who find themselves a bit lots (as I did) when starting a build.</p>

      <p>The electrical side of a van build is something that should be tailored your power requirements. Some people require little more than a few LED lights and obviously don't spend much time worrying about batteries, solar panels and the like. Others want a mega-system that allows them to plug in laptops, kettles, induction stoves, etc.</p>

      <p>Prepare yourself, because my bed-building process winds a path through experimentation. I clock in at around 5'9\" tall. If I owned a NCV3 Sprinter van, I would orient my bed cross-ways, no question. However, since I owned an older T1N van, my height is almost exactly the width I have to work with inside the van.</p>

      <p>When planning out the walls, I had a couple big decisions stump me for awhile: color &amp; material. I settled on color first, white. I wanted to keep the inside of the van very clean and bright. As for material, I initially thought I would install some sort of plastic-based layer -- I had even purchased some thin plastic sheeting from Home Depot with the intention of glueing it over a wood surface.</p>

      <p>At the beginning of my search for a van, the average price tag on the Craigslist listing I saw left me pretty disenchanted with the idea. I expected the prices to be higher than your average Astro van, but seeing old, rusted out, 300k mileage vans still listed for $20,000 was a shock. Luckily, these price tags only reflects the sellers hopes and dreams, not necessarily reality.</p>

      <p>In short, there was no plan other than a few requirements. The van went together all at once with a little bit of measuring, a little bit of drawing and a lot of luck.</p>

      <p>Over the years, I’ve spent quite a bit of time traveling, camping and living off and on in the back of my 2001 Ford Escape. This has been my dream vehicle for over a decade now: it's four wheel drive, seats four, sleeps two with room to spare and it's beefy enough to tow a trailer. I've traveled in it for months at a time. With two people traveling long term, it's tight and you can't take much gear, but it's doable without much fuss.</p>
