    <p>Over the last few years, I’ve spent quite a bit of time traveling, camping and living off and on in the back of my 2001 Ford Escape. This has been my dream vehicle for over a decade now: it's four wheel drive, seats four, sleeps two with room to spare and it's beefy enough to tow a trailer. I've traveled in it for months at a time. With two people traveling long term, it's tight and you can't take much gear, but it's doable without much fuss.</p>

<p>In early 2015, I began thinking about upgrading to something bigger in order to be a little more comfortable on those rainy days and to enable me to take a little more adventure gear with me on those longer trips.</p>
<p>The problem was, since I already had a pretty decent-sized vehicle, upgrading to a small van just didn’t seem worth it — I’d spend a lot to upgrade but not gain a huge amount of space. But on the other hand, I didn't necessarily want to own a huge vehicle. I'd always scoffed at how unnecessarily big modern American vehicles were becoming. In the end, I decided to take the chance -- it was going to be my home for part of the time, so space was a necessity.</p>
<p>If I was going go forward with purchasing something new, I wanted it to meet a few requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuel efficient</li>
<li><strong>Reliable</strong></li>
<li>Semi off road worthy (good clearance)</li>
<li>Maneuverable</li>
<li>Space for climbing gear and bicycles</li>
<li><strong>Stealth</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>What I will be explaining in the next few posts actually took place in March - May of 2015. It is currently January of 2016 and I've finally been coaxed into writing up my experience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since my build took place over the course of about six weeks, I didn't have time or the forethought to take many photos. But I'll try my best to scrape together the few photos I do have and tell you how I managed to buy my van, build it out and keep it running for 20,000 miles and counting.</p>
