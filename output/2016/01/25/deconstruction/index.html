    <p>The following is a synopsis of the van's condition at the time of purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Year: 2004</li>
<li>Mileage: 242,000</li>
<li>Previous owners: At least two</li>
<li>Cab: Clean and in great condition</li>
<li>Cargo area: Shelving and ceiling racks permanently installed</li>
<li>Exterior: Minor rust around the bottom, especially the doors. Undercarriage a bit rusty.</li>
<li>Previous owner had been up on all fluid changes using Mercedes Benz spec fluids</li>
<li>Tires: Rears relatively new, fronts pretty worn</li>
<li>Brakes: When I picked it up, I assumed they were in good shape as the PO had not mentioned them. However, on my trek to Kansas,  the front right began grinding very loudly. I then realized the pad had ground down to bare metal. I replaced them ASAP before continuing my journey.</li>
<li>Paint: Had been repainted early in its life, so the body rust was minimal</li>
</ul>
<p>During my drive home from Connecticut to Las Vegas, I stopped for a few days at my parentsâ€™ in Kansas. Here, I had access to tools I did not have at home, primarily, an angle grinder.</p>
<p>I spent the better part of a two days stripping the interior of the cargo area, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all the shelving</li>
<li>Remove the welded-on ceiling racks</li>
<li>Remove the riveted-on wood floor</li>
<li>Remove the bulkhead between the cab and cargo area</li>
<li>Clean up all interior rust, prime and repaint</li>
</ul>
<p>The worst spot of rust I worked on was the threshold for the rear doors. I ended up removing all plastic pieces, ground it back down to bare metal, applied some <a href="http://amzn.to/1S7wgOZ">rust converter</a>, primed and painted.</p>
<p>Once the van was stripped of all accoutrements (and some rust), I was ready for the final leg of my trip home and to begin the build-out.</p>

<h2>Photos of the deconstruction process</h2>
<p>I admit, I should have take a lot more photos. But this whole process was such a rush that I never stopped to pick up my camera.</p>

<img alt="Deconstruction Photo 2" src="http://localhost:8000/images/deconstruction_photo_2.jpg"></p>
<p>You get the idea: lots of grinding, lots of sparks, some sanding, some painting and it's back as good as new.</p>
<hr>
<p>In retrospect, I should have paid a little more attention to the mechanics. I had tunnel vision for the build out of the interior, so that's all I gave any attention to. My short timeframe didn't allow me any time to spare for anything but the interior. Lesson learned.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next up, time to hit the road back home and get ready to build!</p>
