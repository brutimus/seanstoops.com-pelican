I planned a bikepacking trip up into the Desert National Wildlife Refuge. The route would take me just a little over 50 miles from home, but I knew the roads were going to be tough so stopping early was always an option.

Setting out from home, I had about 20 miles of city streets to navigate before I would find the open desert. The Salsa Fargo I was riding made easy work of the pavement pedaling.

Once I hit the dirt and left the traffic behind, the Fargo really shined as I was able to keep up a pretty good pace.

Until the climbing started...

I made it about 2/3 of the way through the refuge to my destination, but the road ended up being loose vertical washboards hovering at around a 7% grade the entire way. I pedaled and pushed until my legs were on the verge of cramping and the daylight was runnning out before I stopped to setup camp.

The next day took me back down into the valley and through the city.
