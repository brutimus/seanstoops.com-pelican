*This post is a contribution I made to a reddit.com discussion. Since I spend a fair amount of time discussing the various aspects of van-building on reddit.com, I've decided to copy those discussions here for posterity. Please note, however, through these discussions I tend to learn new ideas and change my own perspectives. The snippets I've memorialized here are merely a snapshot in time.*

> I don't know anything about the products you linked, but I thought I'd give you an idea what I did that I'm finding super-comfortable so far.

> We have a giant foam distributor here in Vegas where I've had foam cut for two different van builds. The first build, I had them cut a 4" thick piece of foam for the bed. I think their firmness scale has 5 options with 5 being the most firm. I went with a 4 as it felt nice when I played with a sample they had in the shop.

> After months of using this bed, I decided that it was too firm. I ended up selling that van and building out another. With the second van, i went with a two-ply setup. For the bottom layer, I went with 2 inches of the same foam as the first van. Then, for the top layer, I went with 2 inches of memory foam. This totaled me I think $140 or so. I personally think this bed is a dream to sleep on! If I wanted to use up more vertical room, maybe an extra inch would be nice, but I'm very happy with the 4 inches I have. My girlfriend says she thinks she can feel the wood underneath with her hip bones, but I don't notice anything.

> Anywho, that's all I got. Good luck!
